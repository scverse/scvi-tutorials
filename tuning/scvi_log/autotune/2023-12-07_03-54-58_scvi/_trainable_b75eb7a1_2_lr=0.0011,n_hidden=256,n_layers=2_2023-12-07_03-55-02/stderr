<frozen abc>:119: FutureWarning: SparseDataset is deprecated and will be removed in late 2024. It has been replaced by the public classes CSRDataset and CSCDataset.

For instance checks, use `isinstance(X, (anndata.experimental.CSRDataset, anndata.experimental.CSCDataset))` instead.

For creation, use `anndata.experimental.sparse_dataset(X)` instead.
