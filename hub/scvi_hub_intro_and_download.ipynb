We provide an interface to it in scvi-tools and store pre-trained scvi-tools models on the Hugging Face Model Hub. Read on for more details or jump [here](#Download-models) for practical examples."

    "### What is Hugging Face ðŸ¤—?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hugging Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugging_Face) (HF for short) is a suite of tools for building ML-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hugging Face Hub is a platform for sharing and using pretrained models, as well as other entities such as datasets and demo apps (called Spaces). The [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) â€” the HF Hub for pretained models â€” includes models trained on a variety of tasks including but not limited to NLP, computer vision, audio, and many other domains. You can find more information about the HF Hub [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) and about the HF Model Hub [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-the-hub).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few interesting characteristics of the HF Model Hub that make it ideal for model-sharing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Git-based**. The hub is built on top of Github. This means that you can use all the features of Github to manage your models. For example, you can use Github's pull requests to review changes before committing them. This also means that you can use Github's version control to track changes to your models.\n",
    "- **Community Tab**. Models feature a Community Tab that allows users to ask questions and report issues. This is a great way to get feedback on your models and to help others who are using your models.\n",
    "- **Model Cards**. All models have a uniform UI that makes it easy to find information about the model, without being overly prescriptive. This is realized in the form of a README.md file that serves as the Model Card. The Model Card is a great way to document your model and to provide information about how to use it. You can find more information about the Model Card [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards).\n",
    "- **Discoverability**. You can tag models with a variety of tags to make it easier for users to find your model. For example, you can tag your model with the task it was trained on, the language it uses, the framework it was trained with, and more, including custom tags. These can then be used by users when searching for your model. You can also use the search bar to search for models by name."

    "### What is scvi-hub?\n",
    "\n",
    "scvi-hub, accessible via `import scvi.hub`, allows programmatic access to Hugging Face for uploading (pushing) and downloading (pulling) pretrained model. Under the hood, scvi-hub uses the [huggingface_hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index) Python API to interact with the HF Model Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few ways in which scvi-hub is useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enables HF upload/download operations directly from scvi-tools, so you don't have to learn how to use the `huggingface_hub` API\n",
    "- Lazily loads data and models into memory by deferring loading â€” and in some cases large data downloads â€” unless and until you need them\n",
    "- Provides helpers for creating Model Cards and Hub Models given only the directory where your pretrained model is stored. This way we'll pull out all the interesting info from the model/data objects and populate the Model Card with it so you don't have to.\n",
    "- Provides a common template for the Model Card that you're encouraged â€” but not required â€” to use. This makes most scvi-tools models look consistent on the HF Model Hub. However this is a convenience and not a requirement. You can always create your own Model Card. *scvi-tools does not take any dependency on the contents of the Model Card (including the tags). More on this later.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing the term scvi-hub designates is the collection of pretrained scvi-tools models that are hosted on the HF Model Hub. Currently you can see all such models by clicking [here](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=scvi-tools). Soon, scvi-tools will be a first-class citizen library on the HF Model Hub, which means that you will be able to find all scvi-tools models by clicking on ths scvi-tools library button as shown below."

    "  - Push a new model to the HF Model Hub.\n",
    "  - Pull an existing model from the HF Model Hub.\n",
    "  - Load the pretrained model into memory. This is done by invoking the `HubModel.model` property which will automatically load the model into memory if it is not already loaded. This will also load the data; see below for what that does.\n",
    "  - Load the data that was used to train the model into memory. This is done by invoking the `HubModel.adata` property which will automatically load the data into memory if it is not already loaded. This will also download the data from the given `training_data_url` if needed. We will learn more about large data handling in the scvi-hub upload tutorial.\n",
    "- `scvi.hub.HubModelCardHelper`. As its name indicates, this class helps in generating a Model Card that works for most scvi-tools models. You can do so by calling its `from_dir` class method which will automatically populate the Model Card with relevant information from the model and data objects, located at the given directory. You can also give it some more metadata that cannot be auto-inferred (such as license). The corresponding HF [Model Card](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/cards#huggingface_hub.ModelCard) object is accessible via the `model_card` property.\n",
    "- `scvi.hub.HubMetadata`. This class encapsulates the metadata that is present in the \\_scvi_required_metadata.json file. Like `HubModelCardHelper`, it has a `from_dir` class method that can be used to auto-generate it using the model and data objects located at a given directory."
